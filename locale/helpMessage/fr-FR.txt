**Setup:**
1. Make a channel with the name `#counting` **or** type `c!channel` in the channel you want to count in if you want to use a different name.
2. Start counting in the channel, beginning with `1`.

**Counting rules:**
• One person can't count two numbers in a row. (A friend/partner is required)
• No botting.
• If you break count, a "save" will be docked from your save count if you have any. Otherwise, the count will reset.

**Saves:**
• Vote [here](https://counting.duckgroup.xyz/vote) to earn more saves. Check your amount of saves with `c!vote`.
• If you have at least one save, you can continue counting when you type a number wrong.
